## Description

This is a restaurant reviews app - mobile-ready web application, responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader users. The app is built with an offline-first approach - it provides a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Tools & Dependencies

This app was built with Javascript (ES6), HTML, CSS.  

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).  

App was tested and works on modern browsers - Firefox, Chrome, Edge. Internet Explorer 11 is not supported.

## Installation

Clone the repository with Git Bash: `git clone https://github.com/BarbaraStempien/FEND--Restaurant-Reviews-App.git`  

Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
